# Cat-Vs-Dog-Image-Classification

In my project called Cat-Vs-Dog-Image-Classification, created special computer programs using Neural Networks that can tell if a picture is of a cat or a dog. These Neural Networks are built using a technique called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). They can learn from lots of pictures of cats and dogs to become really good at recognizing them.

The networks have different parts that help them understand pictures better. They can look for patterns and shapes in the pictures using special layers. By training them with a big collection of labeled cat and dog pictures, they can learn to tell the difference between the two with high accuracy.

The purpose of my Cat-Vs-Dog-Image-Classification project is to make it easier for computers to recognize and differentiate between cats and dogs. This can be helpful in many ways, like automatically sorting animal pictures or assisting in pet identification. By using Neural Networks and training them with lots of pictures, we can teach computers to identify cats and dogs more effectively.
