# Cat-Vs-Dog-Image-Classification

The purpose of my Cat-Vs-Dog-Image-Classification project is to make it easier for computers to recognize and differentiate between cats and dogs. This can be helpful in many ways, like automatically sorting animal pictures or assisting in pet identification. By using Neural Networks and training them with lots of pictures, we can teach computers to identify cats and dogs more effectively.
